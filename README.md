# ACP Registry

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**: This registry is under active development. Format and contents may change.

A registry of agents and extensions implementing the [Agent Client Protocol, ACP](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol).

> **Note**: This registry only includes agents that support [authentication](AUTHENTICATION.md). Agents must implement auth flows to be listed here. See also the [ACP auth methods proposal](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol/blob/main/docs/rfds/auth-methods.mdx).
